== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to pay for the AI models? =

No! HuggingFace provides free access to their inference API for moderate usage. You just need to create a free account and generate an API token.

= Will this slow down my website? =

The plugin is designed for performance. The keyword filtering happens first and is extremely fast. AI analysis only occurs if keywords don't catch the content, and it runs asynchronously during comment submission.

= Can I customize the blocked keywords? =

Yes! You can add, remove, or modify the keyword list in the admin settings. The plugin comes with a comprehensive default list covering common spam categories.

= What happens when a comment is blocked? =

The user sees a friendly error message explaining their comment contains inappropriate content. The comment is never saved to your database, and the attempt is logged for your review.

= Can I whitelist certain users? =

Yes, users with 'manage_options' capability (administrators) bypass all filtering automatically.

= Is the plugin GDPR compliant? =

Yes, the plugin only processes comment data during submission and doesn't store personal information beyond what WordPress normally logs.
